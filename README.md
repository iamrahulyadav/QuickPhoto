# Summary
It's like mini clone of modern social media app's camera activity. But it uses native canvas drawing. 
I choosed minimum optimal image and preview size for performance. You can maximize it if you want to.

# Instructions
This app vey minimalistic. It dont have any buttons for instructions.
It uses purely gestures.

- Single Tap: Take Photo
- Double Tap: Change Camera
- Pinch: Zoom

After taking photo you end up in photo preview fragment.
Tap screen to write text to the image. And drag and drop wherever you want. Pinch for scale text.
Press save button to save photo.
Photo will be saved in your pictures folder.
